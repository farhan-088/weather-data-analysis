# Weather Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves exploratory analysis and data preprocessing on a weather dataset. It covers:
- Missing value handling
- Feature engineering
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Initial visualizations and insights

## Dataset
A sample weather dataset (`data/weather.csv`) containing daily weather metrics like temperature, humidity, and precipitation.

## Contents
- `notebooks/01_data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Preprocessing steps, summary stats, and visualizations
- `scripts/`: Reusable functions for data cleaning and feature engineering
- `visuals/`: Charts and graphs generated

## How to Run
1. Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Launch the Jupyter notebook
3. Follow the code in `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb`
